                    <strong>Q.</strong> What is scambaiting?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>A.</strong> Scambaiting is baiting scammers (as the name suggests). You know those numbers that show on those websites that claim your PC is infected with some fake nonsense? Scambaiting is calling them up, pretending to fall for the scam and calling the scammer out at the end of the process!

                <p>
                    <strong>A.</strong> It's just a meme. Scammers usually switch their Vs and Ws when they speak.
